## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This is the first Rust backend project I have made while learning Rust programing language.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```sh
TODO: add install rust up
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```sh
cargo make --makefile ./Cargo.toml watch # development

# TODO: Update document for production
```

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Tests are written with Postman Flows.
